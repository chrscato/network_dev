-1. setup in the the best .db destination where there's status for whether a contract is created, if it should be send out, etc

-1a. this will be basically a status viewer for my PowerAutomate webflow that hits this virtual machine every 10 min looking for the status and can pull any documents needed.

-1b. how do you recommend we setup this 'billboard' of sorts to where the powerautomate pulls the documents, the meta data to put into its own excel which will act as a db for correspondance tracking (and eventually send back post HTTP messages for the user to monitor here) 

-1c. i recommend a json format where the powerautomate can identify and parse it into an excel easily

-1d can the webapp here know when a powerautomate hits our status 'billboard' and then we can remove it from the billboard.
